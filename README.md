# Tool Rental Programming Demonstration

### Overview

- This is a Spring Boot based Java console app that demonstrates basic dependency injection as well as some newer Java
features.

- I opted to use inheritance and composition to model the tool catalog to demonstrate some new Java 17 features instead of
having a persistent back-end using JPA and an in-memory relational DB. I have separated out a RentalToolService that has
some comments/docs in it that outline how it could be migrated to use a persistent DB instead.
