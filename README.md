# Tool Rental Programming Demonstration

### Overview
- This is a Spring Boot based Java console app that demonstrates basic dependency injection as well as some newer Java
features.
- There are some comments in the Services and Repos pointing out spots where a persistent JPA-based solution could be
swapped in.

### How to test or run
- Integration tests for the overall rental calculation logic can be found in IntegrationTests
- The app can be run as a console app where you can input values manually for tool rental checkout and see user-friendly 
error messaging
